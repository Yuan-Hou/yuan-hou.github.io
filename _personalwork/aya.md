A PyQt-based screenshot program that captures a fixed-resolution area at a specified scale to facilitate my collection of illustration datasets on the web.

Helped me collect a lot of illustrations about my favorite anime characters and organize them right into the most appropriate format.

Facilitated my own training of the desired embedding and LoRa for Diffusion drawing.
