A website developed in PHP to coordinate team members' schedules and support the import of class schedules from the school website.

The first software class in the first half of my freshman year required teams of three to develop static web pages, and I was mainly responsible for our group's development work, and our group's project was the only one in the class that had a back-end.

My final score was 94.
