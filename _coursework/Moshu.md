The course required us to form a team of 5 people to develop a website in two iterations within 10 days according to the Agile model.

I was the team leader, and I was responsible for organizing daily meetings and reports. In actual development, I was responsible for interfacing between the front and back ends, as well as the CI/CD and final deployment of the project. Since the co-editing and prototyping features are more closely related to deployment, I was also responsible for programming these two user stories.

My final score was 97.
