The Object-oriented programming course required us to develop arbitrary programs in java, and I teamed up with two other housemates to complete the development of this game.

I was mainly responsible for the framework design of the game, including random dungeon generator, physics engine call, weapon system, blood system, etc. The other two housemates were responsible for designing various characters and weapons, as well as designing shaders, materials, animations and so on.
