This class required us to form teams of five and develop a campus forum following a waterfall model to manage the development process. I was the team leader and was responsible for both front-end and back-end development. I was mainly responsible for the front-end development of the personal information page and the posting page, and I was responsible for the back-end development of various interfaces.
